# FasteResFPN : Deep Learning for Automated Microplastic Detection in Aquatic Environments
FasterResFPN is an end-to-end, deep learningâ€“based object detection system engineered to enable large-scale microplastic surveillance in natural waters. Built upon Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 + Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone, it leverages multi-scale feature learning to classify and localize four major categories of microplastic particles: fibers, fragments, pellets, and films.
Trained on the Microplastic-100 dataset, the system achieves state-of-the-art recall while maintaining competitive precision, making it a strong alternative to costly and time-consuming laboratory techniques such as FTIR and Raman spectroscopy.
